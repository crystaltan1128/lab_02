Twitter is used all over the world as a social platform for many, but it may also be used as means of communication and news. Given that it is useable given accessability, when making comparisons, we are mostly able to look at developed countries and how their twitter data differs. In this lab, I decided to look at geo-tagged tweets in the United States and compare it to tweets in all of Europe. I chose these two locations because when I personally think about social media usage, in this case Twitter, I associate those who are most active on the app to be from either the United States or a country in Europse. Although we are comparing a country to a continent, in this case, the results are more drastic than expacted.

## Map of United States

In this map of geo-tagged tweets in the United States, we can see an abundance of tweers on the east and west coast. The states in the central west on the country do not show as many tweets compared to the states along the coasts. Moving from west to east, we can see an increase in frequency of tweets starting along the midwestern states. 

## Map of Europe

In this map of geo-tagged tweets in Europe, there is a concentration of tweets in the United Kingdom. Besides this one cluster, there is no other noticeable pattern.

Comparing the two maps together, we can see there is a significant difference between the two areas. There looks to be more tweets being sent out in the United States compared to all of Europe. Looking at the map of Europe, the tweet data is more sparse and there is very little clustering. On the other hand, the map of tweets in the United States shows many clusters along the coasts and the midwest. 
A reason for the different geospatial patterns could be that Twitter is an American company and remains one of the most popular social media platforms for Americans. Countries in Europe may have developed their own apps that serve similar function to Twitter. It is possible that the European populations will gravitate toward these platforms compared to Twitter. Another possible reason for the difference in patterns is that the specific functionality of Twitter is not preferred by those who live in European countries. It is possible that the application's aspects that make it favorable in the United States is not as sought after in Europe. 

Another aspect of these geo-tagged tweets that we can look at is the commonly used words within each location. This is represented using word clouds where the most frequently used words will appear larger in comparison to the less frequently used words. These word clouds can aid in visualizing the differences in useage of Twitter among the two locations.

Looking at the two word clouds, we can see that there are quite a few similarity in words, such as: *Love, Thank, Lol, and Year(s).* Although it is difficult to make clear comparisons, we can see that in the word cloud for tweets in Europe, there are more mentions of political matters and religion. This can be seen through the words: *politics, fake, war, god, and bless.* In the word cloud for the United States, we see that there are more mentions of activities and the concept of time. This can be seen through the words: *new, time, week, work, year, night, start, and game.* This can be due to siddrent ideals throughout each region. It is possible that Americans fel more expressive about their passtimes and their daily lives, whereas Europeans may share more tweets about specific matters significant to them.
Although comparing these word clouds will not help us clearly distinguish the types of tweets that each location will send out, we can get some insight on the ideas being spread throughout each region.
